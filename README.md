# Portfolio
A portfolio of the apps I've been creating while learning javascript (MEAN stack)

It includes the following apps currently (*After a huge mental argument with myself whether to create this readme once there are enough apps here to actually make an index for*)

1. The Porfolio itself.( Hey! It has code === It counts as an app!)
2. Quote generator which speaks. ( more of a corny pick up lines-generator. might have to modify this one a bit before linking this to a recruiter)
3. Pomodoro timer.
4. Calculator

editing just to see how this branch works
